# 🌍 Manglish Translator

**Manglish Translator** is an open-source tool that converts **Malayalam written in English script (Manglish)** into its corresponding **English meaning** — not just transliteration, but actual contextual translation.

> 🧠 Example:  
> `"ningal evideya pokunnathu"` → `"Where are you going?"`

---

## 🔎 What Is Manglish?

**Manglish** is a common way for Malayalam speakers to communicate using the English alphabet. While easy for humans, it's challenging for machines to understand or translate.

This project bridges that gap by translating Manglish directly to proper English sentences — enabling communication, chatbot training, data analysis, and more.

---

## 💡 What This Project Does

- 🗣️ Translates conversational Manglish to natural English  
- 📁 Uses a growing dataset of Manglish-English pairs  
- 🔧 Easy to extend and integrate into your projects  
- 🧪 (Planned) Support for basic NLP models to auto-translate new inputs

---

## ✨ Example

```python
from manglish_translator import translate

print(translate("ningal evideya pokunnathu"))
# Output: "Where are you going?"

🔧 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/manglish-translator.git
